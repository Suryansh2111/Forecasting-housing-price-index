# Forecasting-housing-price-index
"This project analyzes the U.S. Housing Price Index (1991â€“2013) using time series methods. After cleaning and enhancing the dataset with economic variables, we applied SARIMA and SARIMAX models. The SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model provided the best forecast accuracy, capturing both trend and seasonality."
